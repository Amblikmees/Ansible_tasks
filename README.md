LEVEL1:

Level 1 is relatively simple and doesn;t require much experience with Ansible.

Tasks:

    Set the timezone to UTC
    Install NGINX
    start NGINX and make sure port 80 is listening
    Your index.html file must contain the string "Sorry for the inconvenience but"

Level2:

Slightly harder but you shold have no issues with this.

Tasks:

    Create 3 users [tom:UID 2001, dick:UID 2002 & harry:UID 3001]
    For users with a UID < 3000, add them to the "wheel" group
